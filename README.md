## Introduction

**MarineEvoEcoLab/PublicResourceSection** provides information on the materials and methods used in the experimental aquarium design. This includes a description of [system design](#SystemDesign), [list of parts](##PartsList), and [code](https://github.com/MarineEvoEcoLab/PublicResourcesSection/docs/Scripts) paramount to the experiment. 

## System Design

![Hyrule schematic](assets/media/Hyrule.jpg)

**Figure 1** **A)** Break down of system design. Seawater chemistry is altered within the header tanks, within which carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas are used to alter seawater pH and dissolved oxygen. Treated seawater (CO2 and N2 gas) is actively pumped from the high treatment header tank into buckets H1-H4. Unmodified water (Ambient Air) is actively pumped from the control treatment header tank into C1-C4. Buckets 1-3 contain larvae, whereas buckets with probes contain no larvae. **B)** Break down of bucket design. Seawater is actively pumped from the water line through a flow meter which is adjacent to activated carbon. a constant mixing of seawater is maintained with a stir bar/plate. Seawater is passively pumped out of the system through a banjo filter.
